#Used VS code to build run and push the image

#First we create the Java program file named Wordcounter.java
#Similarly created Dockerfile, sai.txt(read by program to count the repeated words)

#The commands for docker will be;

docker pull openjdk        #We first pull the base image
docker build -t myjavaapp .      #We build a new image named "myjavaapp"

#We can check the images by giving command
docker images

docker run -dit myjavaapp        #We run the image 
docker commit 96bb6e3b188c saicharanj/myrepo:new       # 96bb6e3b188c is the ID of Image my-counter
docker push saicharanj/myrepo:new        #We push the image to docker public repository

#To pull this image use the command
docker pull saicharanj/myrepo:new        #new is the tag given
